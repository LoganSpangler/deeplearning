## Welcome Deep Learning on Qubole Data Services

Qubole is an Autonmous Data Platform built on Open Source Technology. Qubole makes Big Analytics Data Easy by enabling Analytics on Cloud **EASY**.

Artificial Intelligence brings actions closer to analysis, making business process truly self driving and not only self serving. It cuts the manual process of analysis to work directly on Actions. Whether it is Drones to Supply Chain, flying cars to smart environments. From environmental impact of reducing data center costs done by Deep Mind for Google, or making roads safer with Self Driving Cars used by NVIDIA, Google or Uber, making lives more prosperous.

Cameras can now see, microphones can here and detect, text are understood in context. Languages are understood, speech can be mimcked, art can be generated.

### Deep Learning

With the recent discoveries in Activation Functions, cheap compute teraflops of compute with (GPUs), AI is moving into every part of our lives.

The recent remark by Sundar Pichai from Google in 2017 Google I/O is a great example. Google is bringing AI to every product. Google has changed from Mobile First to AI First company.[Google Ai](https://google.ai/ "Google AI")

### Apache Zepplin Notebook

In this section we take a humble approach and show you how you can leverage data to make Artificial Intelligent actions on your data. 

- Build Smart Models
- Take Actions

This code base works with Qubole Data Service Platform. The modules are built on Zepplin Notebook which can be imported into your QDS environment.

### Repository

The **Aim** of these notebooks is to give you an introduction to the Tensorflow and Keras libraries and give you how you could use them on your uses cases. At Qubole the plan is to enable customers with Deep Learning capabilities. This repository is for sample code and to get started on QDS with deep learning capabilities. 


- Start with the **Hello World** examples in the tensorflow folder


The github repo provides details on the samples.

```
	tensorflow - Contains code for tensorflow
	mxmet - Contains sample code for Apache Mxnet
	startup_scripts - These are QDS startup scripts


```

Notebooks - These are Zepplin Notebooks. You can directly import them by linking from Qubole Github link.
The details on the documentation for QDS and Zepplin can be found here - [QDS Zepplin](http://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/features/notebook/link-notebook-github.html)
